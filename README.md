# SafeBike
Whether you're organizing a fun run, marathon, or bikathon, SafeBike is the app for you! BikeSafe is not only an amazing way to share the run/bike route of your event, but if anyone runs into any trouble - whether it be a flat tire, injury or deydration - an alert system is featured so you can get help right away! At the push of a button, a volunteer will be notified so they may come and assist you. That way you can focus more on the fun and worry less about the not-so fun stuff!
